shortdescription: Semi supervised methods for event reconstruction at the LHC

description: >

  The most common approach to reconstructing full scale events at general purpose
  detectors (such as ATLAS and CMS) is a particleflow-like algorithm [1â€“3] which
  combines low-level information (PF-elements) from different sub-detectors to
  reconstruct stable particles (PF-candidates). Attempts are being developed to
  improve upon the current PF-algorithm with machine learning (ML) methods and
  improving particle reconstruction in general. Within CMS, a work has been conducted
  [4] to develop a graph neural network (GNN) model by the name MLPF [5] to reproduce
  the existing PF algorithm. The proposed MLPF algorithm has the advantage of running
  on heterogeneous computing architectures and may be efficient when scaling up to
  accommodate the high luminosity LHC upgrade. MLPF works by reconstructing high
  level PF candidates, in a supervised fashion [6], model from low level PF-elements.
  We propose to test new self-supervised learning (SSL) ideas, borrowed from computer
  vision tasks, to pre-train the MLPF model before performing the downstream task of
  event reconstruction. In particular, a method by the name VICReg [7] was developed
  under the umbrella of contrastive SSL in computer vision. In the pre-training phase,
  the algorithm relies on taking two views of the same image and learns to associate
  their embeddings in some latent space. The aim is to learn efficient latent
  representations before performing the downstream task. In the case of MLPF, a natural
  way to think of two (or more) views of the same event is by considering the different
  sub detector systems (e.g. track hits and calorimeter clusters). In addition, other
  event augmentations, that are physics-motivated, may be considered (e.g. Lorentz boosts).
  We expect that pre-training MLPF on a huge amount of unlabeled LHC data can provide
  better performance, and better domain adaptation (e.g. from MC to data).
