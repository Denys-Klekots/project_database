shortdescription: Development of new algorithm that finds generic vertices in the LHCb using GPUs.
description: >
  The project is dedicated to the development of an innovative algorithm designed to identify displaced decay vertices within the LHCb experiment. The primary aim of this algorithm is to facilitate an inclusive search methodology for long-lived particles, transcending the conventional approach of targeting specific decay signatures. This  strategy requires the algorithm to effectively differentiate and suppress vertices associated with well-established long-lived hadrons, necessitating the integration of ML solutions. This approach will enable the analysis to be adaptable to a wide range of New Physics models. Furthermore, the algorithm is constrained by computational speed requirements of the online HLT1 trigger at LHCb.

  The student will develop the algorithm to be run on GPUs, which requires some experience with CUDA, C++ and Python.
